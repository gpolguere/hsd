{"name":"Hsd","body":"# HSD\r\n\r\nScripts from <a href=\"http://jonrohan.me/guide/git/dead-simple-git-workflow-for-agile-teams/\">Jon Rohan</a>\r\n\r\nI tweaked them a little bit in order to play with other branches than master.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Download the files. You should have all the scripts in a folder named 'scripts'.\r\n2. Move that folder wherever you want.\r\n3. Edit your '.bash_profile' file in order to add the 'scripts' path to your PATH environment variable (just add `:scripts_path` at the end of the line `export PATH=$PATH:...` to get something like this : `export PATH=$PATH:/Users/gilp/dev/scripts`)\r\n4. Save and close the '.bash_profile' file\r\n5. You should be good!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Checkout a new branch to work on a feature\r\n\r\n```\r\ngcb new_feature\r\n```\r\n\r\n### HSD\r\n\r\nThis script executes the hack & ship & dwf scripts.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhsd\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nhsd dev\r\n```\r\nif your main branch is 'dev'\r\n\r\nI advise you to run the script `hack` before `hsd`. If there's no conflicts with the `hack` script, then you can run the `hsd` script, else solve the conflicts and run the `hack` script again. That should be all!\r\n\r\n#### Hack\r\n\r\nThis script gets commits from the main branch (master if not set) and rebases the feature branch to the main branch.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhack\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nhack dev\r\n```\r\nif your main branch is 'dev'\r\n\r\n#### Ship\r\n\r\nThis script merge commits from the feature branch to the main branch (master if not set) and pushes the main branch.\r\n\r\n```\r\nship\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nship dev\r\n```\r\nif your main branch is 'dev'\r\n\r\n#### Done With Feature\r\n\r\nThis script deletes the feature branch and checkouts the main branch (master if not set).\r\n\r\n```\r\ndwf\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\ndwf dev\r\n```\r\nif your main branch is 'dev'","tagline":"Scripts from Jon Rohan on Dead Simple Git Workflow for Agile Teams","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
